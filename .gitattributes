# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
#* text=auto

# Git will always convert line endings to `LF` on checkout. You should use this for files that must keep LF endings, even on Windows:
* text eol=lf

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout.
#*.c text
#*.h text

# Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout.
*.sln text eol=crlf

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified.
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
